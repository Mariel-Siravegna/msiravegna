abstract: Using data from seven local elections (1992-2016) in all the 345 municipalities of Chile, we study whether the political success of women running for mayor has effects on subsequent elections in terms of women participation. We apply a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect using close mixed-gender races.
